## Trench Crusade Rulebook (WIP)
Welcome to the **UNofficial** GitHub repository for the Trench Crusade tabletop game rulebook. I am a simple fan who wants to contribute to the growing TC community.

## About Trench Crusade
Trench Crusade is a skirmish-scale tabletop miniatures game that will plunge players deep into a horrifying alternate timeline. During the Crusades, a heretical band of Templars dared defy the Almighty and, casting aside their sacred vows, unleashed the forces of Hell upon the Earth. Over 800 years later, in the Year of Our Lord 1914, this brutal, merciless war between the forces of Heaven and Hell rages on. This is not just a fight for survival but a cataclysmic struggle that will decide the very fate of humanity's soul.

Mike Franchina created Trench Crusade, and Tuomas Pirinen wrote the game's rules.
